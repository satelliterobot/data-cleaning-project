Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains a script that makes a smaller version of the
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

You should have the LaF and dplyr libraries installed before using this.

To run the script, start R and type  
source("run_analysis.R")

The script will download the dataset, and create a new file named
"new_tidy_data.csv".
